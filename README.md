This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques, applying models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains PCA-transformed features (V1–V28), Time, Amount, and a binary fraud label, the project addresses the challenge of highly imbalanced data where fraud cases are extremely rare. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and detailed evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification reports, and ROC-AUC scores. The project is organized with clear modules for preprocessing, training, and evaluation, and saves trained models along with visual outputs like the ROC curve for comparison. Results show that Logistic Regression works well as a baseline, Random Forest offers improved robustness, and XGBoost consistently achieves the best ROC-AUC performance. Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, and joblib, this end-to-end system demonstrates an effective and deployable approach to fraud detection.
